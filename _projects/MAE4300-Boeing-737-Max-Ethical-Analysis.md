The Boeing 737 Max crashes represent not only a technical failure, but an ethical breakdown across individual, organizational, and systemic levels. The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was the immediate technical trigger, but the root of the issues goes much deeper. Cost-driven decision-making, inadequate transparency, regulatory ambiguity, and a corporate culture that prioritized competition and money over public safety were the core issues that allowed the technical failure to occur and fester.

At the technical level, MCAS relied on input from a single angle-of-attack (AoA) sensor, creating a single point of failure in a safety-critical system. This violated fundamental engineering principles of redundancy, especially important in aerospace. When that sensor malfunctioned, MCAS repeatedly forced the aircraft’s nose downward without sufficient safeguards or pilot override logic. Compounding this risk, MCAS was not disclosed as a novel system and was excluded from pilot manuals, limiting pilots’ ability to diagnose or respond to its behavior in real time. These design choices were known internally and represented a conscious departure from aviation safety norms.

However, the ethical failures extend beyond technical design. Organizationally, Boeing prioritized speed to market and cost containment in response to competitive pressure from Airbus. Management decisions discouraged extended verification, minimized pilot retraining to preserve the aircraft’s marketability, and framed MCAS as a minor software adjustment rather than a flight-critical system. Engineers who raised concerns struggled to gain traction due to hierarchical pressure and unclear authority boundaries, and fear of professional repercussions. This environment diluted individual responsibility and fostered a culture where safety concerns could be overridden by a disconnected leadership structure. 

Regulatory dynamics further exacerbated these failures. The FAA’s delegation of certification authority to Boeing created ambiguity around accountability and weakened independent oversight. Engineers were permitted to assume that compliance with minimum regulatory standards was sufficient, even when ethical engineering practice demanded higher scrutiny. This regulatory structure allowed Boeing to self-certify critical aspects of MCAS, reducing external checks precisely where independent review was most necessary. As a result, systemic safeguards failed to compensate for organizational shortcomings

From an ethical standpoint, these actions conflict directly with the ASME Code of Ethics, particularly Canon 1, which requires engineers to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. In multiple instances, Boeing prioritized company goals over basic ethical responsibility. Loyalty to employers, cost efficiency, and regulatory compliance were treated as equal to or even superior to public safety. When safety-critical systems are involved, public welfare must take precedence over economic or institutional interests. The decision to certify MCAS despite known single-point failures, limited pilot awareness, and a lack of simulator testing represents a failure to apply ethical hierarchy appropriately.

These underlying failures led to the loss of hundreds of lives, erosion of public trust in aviation safety, and long-term reputational and financial damage to Boeing itself. Importantly, these outcomes undermine the argument that cost-benefit tradeoffs justified the original decisions. In retrospect, prioritizing safety through redundancy, transparency, and rigorous oversight would have prevented both human tragedy and corporate harm.

More ethical conduct was possible at every level. Individually, engineers should have been empowered and protected when raising safety concerns, supported by clearer whistleblower protections and ethical training emphasizing professional responsibility over organizational loyalty. Organizationally, Boeing should have institutionalized safety review boards independent of program management, mandated full disclosure of system changes to pilots and regulators, and resisted framing safety enhancements as optional costs. Systemically, regulators should have limited self-certification authority and strengthened independent review of flight-control software.

Ultimately, the Boeing 737 Max case demonstrates that ethical engineering is not achieved through technical competence alone. It requires organizational cultures that reward transparency, regulatory systems that enforce accountability, and professionals who recognize that compliance is not the ceiling of ethical responsibility. Engineers have the opportunity to create tremendous impact with innovative technology that many people interact with. However, this level of impact emphasized the importance of ethical conduct in order to ensure the safety of millions and billions of people.
